"""Positions and orientations of components in the lab frame, as McStas computes them.

A component sits at ``at`` (m) in the frame of the component named ``relative`` (``None`` means
the lab frame). It is rotated by ``rotated`` (deg, about x, then y, then z) relative to that
frame, as McStas AT and ROTATED with RELATIVE.

A value may be a McStas expression of instrument parameters such as ``"-chi"`` (see
:func:`.utils.evaluate`). A rotation is the matrix from the lab frame to the component's own
frame, as ``rot_set_rotation`` in McStas's mccode-r.c.
